This is the teaser line.

This is the rest of the cruft.

If you enabled [syntax highlighting](https://www.getgutenberg.io/documentation/getting-started/configuration/#syntax-highlighting), the following should work:

```php
 = file_get_contents("http://nidium.com");
```

As you can see, the github link also works by adding this to the `extra` settings in this page.
